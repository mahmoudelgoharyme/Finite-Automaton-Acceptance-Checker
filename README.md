# Finite-Automaton-Acceptance-Checker
This repository contains a Python program for checking the acceptability of strings in a Finite State Machine (FSM). The program allows users to define the FSM by providing the number of states, inputs, transitions, and final states. It then evaluates user-provided strings to determine if they are acceptable within the specified FSM.
